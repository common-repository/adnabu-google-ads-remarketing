= What is Dynamic Remarketing? =
Dynamic remarketing is a better version of remarketing where the ad shown to a user is influenced by the products visited. For eg: A user might see an ad for shirts if he had previously browsed shirts category. Dynamic remarketing is extremely effective for e-commerce companies due to high context.

= Problems while setting up Dynamic Remarketing =
Setting up dynamic retargeting is very hard. Two obvious requirements are Google merchant Center and AdWords account. Once these are setup, advertisers need to create a remarketing tag and implement them across the website with correct parameters. Manually editing theme files is the only manual way to do this which results in lot of errors.

AdNabu automatically creates the remarketing tag and implements it across all the pages. You do not have to edit any files or do anything manually. We will also create audiences in AdWords so that any new campaign can take advantage of them.
